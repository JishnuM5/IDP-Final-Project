# Raw Data
All raw .csv data is available here. For the NSCH datasets, in order to get the original .sas7bdat files, unzip the [nsch_2016-2023e_topical.zip](nsch_2016-2023e_topical.zip) file.  

The `to_csv()` method in the [preprocess_data.py](../preprocess_data.py) file was used to generate these .csv datasets for NSCH. The HBSC datasets were obtained as .csv files.
