# Plots
## Final Generated Plots
All final plots for this project can be found in this folder. Run the [main.py](../main.py) file to regenerate the plots. Refer to the plot generation functions in this file for plot descriptions

## Plot Sketches
Here is the link to a Google Drive folder with all plot sketches: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m-SeJ7mwC1khtW_OJlFm8n8AwQFLNMXJ

Descriptions are below:
 > **interactive**: This is what we imagine our interactive graph looking like (we may use countries other than US). The user can pick a year using the slider, mental health and screen time indicators using the drop down menus, and view the correlation between the two variables in different states during that time.  

 > **ml_bar**: This bar chart is our ML plot sketch. It displays the  weightage, in percentage, of different features in a tree model for predicting a certain label related to mental health. We will likely use a random forest classifier, and create multiple of these graphs to observe how weightage changes with hyperparameters.

 > **pop_pyr**: This is a unique use of the population pyramid where, instead of looking at the population distribution for different genders across ages, we are looking at the screen time distribution across ages between those needing mental health treatment and those not needing it.  

 > **scatter**: This scatterplot considers whether certain external factors can act as buffers or catalysts for the correlation between mental health and screen time (i.e. whether the correlations are stronger/weaker in certain subgroups).  

 > **stacked_bar**: This bar chart looks at the relative frequency of difficulty making friends across groups, separated based on screen time.
